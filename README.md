## Some parts taken from this work
- Use DOM for UI elements
- Use a 3D format dedicated to the engine (see Blender exporter)
- Use a 3D format with frame by frame animations

## How to integrate your 3D models ?
The Blender extension allows you to export your models in Aliyah compatible formats!

## Roadmap
- Build a community and have fun together !
- Pass to ES6 import/export
- Implement Skybox
- Implement Mipmap
- Implement BSP (Binary Space Partitionning)
