## Getting started
You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 
Once installation is done, let's build our first project.     

Clone this repo, go to the root of project and launch the build with the following command:
```
// you need to install dependencies
# npm install

// now, you can start with
# npm run dev
```

## How to integrate your 3D models ?
The [aliyah-blender-exporter](https://github.com/Anuban-corp/aliyah-blender-exporter) allows you to export your models in Aliyah compatible formats!
