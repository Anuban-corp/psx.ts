## Getting started
You need to install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [browserify](https://browserify.org/).    
Once installation is done, let's build our first project.     

Download either the [complete solution](https://aliyah-engine.com/pub/1.0.0/starters/aliyah-starter.zip) with all packages included or the [minimal solution](https://aliyah-engine.com/pub/1.0.0/starters/aliyah-minimal-starter.zip) with only core package.     
Go to the root of project and launch the build with the following command:
```
// you need to build from the project root
# browserify src/main.js -o build/dist.js
```

Now, run your prefered web server (nginx, live-server, apache, nodejs, etc...), visit your localhost and you will see the project running. Let's go to write some code and add some [packages](https://aliyah-engine.com/download) to build your own web videogames.

## How to integrate your 3D models ?
The [Blender extension](https://aliyah-engine.com/pub/1.0.0/aliyah-blender-exporter.zip) allows you to export your models in Aliyah compatible formats!

## Examples
- [Rotating cube](https://aliyah-engine.com/samples/rotating-cube/)
- [3D pre-rendered](https://aliyah-engine.com/samples/prerendered/)
- [3D pre-rendered isometric](https://aliyah-engine.com/samples/prerendered-isometric/)
- [2D tilemap](https://aliyah-engine.com/samples/tilemap/)
- [2D tilemap with pathfinding](https://aliyah-engine.com/samples/tilemap-pathfinding/)

## Contributions

4. Push to the Branch (git push origin new_feature)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Some parts taken from this work
- Use DOM for UI elements
- Use a 3D format dedicated to the engine (see Blender exporter)
- Use a 3D format with frame by frame animations

## Roadmap
- Build a community and have fun together !
- Pass to ES6 import/export
- Implement Skybox
- Implement Mipmap
- Implement BSP (Binary Space Partitionning)
