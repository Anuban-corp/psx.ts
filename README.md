**Aliyah** is a simple and modular web library to build videogames.    
**Aliyah** support both **2D** (canvas) and **3D** (webgpu).    
No need to learn a new language, if you master **HTML/JS/CSS** then you can create a professional and very optimized videogames with **Aliyah**.

## Getting started from starter-kit
First, check that Node.js is installed on your environment.    
Then go to [download](https://sprightly-beijinho.netlify.app/download) the complete or minimal solution of Aliyah.    

## Getting started from scratch
You just need layout page file and a javascript entry point file (aka: main.js).   
The layout HTML5 snippet, usually named **index.html** :
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="fr">

<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/styles/core.css" />
  <script rel="preload" type="text/javascript" src="build/dist.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <center><h1>Boilerplate</h1></center>
  <div id="APP" style="margin: 0 auto">
    <div id="APP_FAIL"></div>
    <canvas id="CANVAS_3D" width="1px" height="1px"></canvas>
    <canvas id="CANVAS_2D" width="1px" height="1px"></canvas>
    <div id="UI_ROOT"></div>
    <div id="UI_FADELAYER"></div>
    <div id="UI_OVERLAYER"></div>
  </div>
</body>

</html>
```
The Javascript entry point usually named **main.js** :
```js
window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
  let then = 0;

  (function run(timeStamp) {
    let ts = timeStamp - then;
    then = timeStamp;
    requestAnimationFrame(timeStamp => run(timeStamp));
  }(0));
});
```

Now you can add and used [packages](https://sprightly-beijinho.netlify.app/download) of your choice and enjoy it !

## Some parts taken from this work
- Use DOM for UI elements
- Use a 3D format dedicated to the engine (see Blender exporter)
- Use a 3D format with frame by frame animations

## How to integrate your 3D models ?
The Blender extension allows you to export your models in Aliyah compatible formats!

## Roadmap
- Build a community and have fun together !
- Pass to ES6 import/export
- Implement Skybox
- Implement Mipmap
- Implement BSP (Binary Space Partitionning)
